.SYNOPSIS  
    Distribute the tests in VSTS pipeline across multiple agents 
.DESCRIPTION  
    This script slices tests files across multiple agents for faster execution.
    We search for specific type of file structure (in this example test*), and slice them according to agent number
    If we encounter multiple files [file1..file10] and if we have 2 agents, agent1 executes tests odd number of files while agent2 executes even number of files
    We use JUnit test results to publish the test reports.
